## Deploy a Vue App

In this tutorial, we advice creating a Dockerfile and using Docker as the build system

1. Fork/Clone this [Hostless-Vue-Example](https://github.com/Hostless-Examples/Hostless-Vue-Example) repo from github
2. Click on 'Create New App'
3. Choose a suitable app name
4. Choose your github account
5. Choose the forked github repo/the cloned remote repo
6. Choose a build system

    1. 'Docker' - looks for a Dockerfile in the root of the project and build based on the instructions

8. The PORT environment variable is set by Hostless but also ensure your Dockerfile exposes PORT 8000
